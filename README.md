# AllTheStars
Extra project I took on after a typescript lecture

_All the stars_ is a simple game, catch all the falling stars and hold on to the magic...
I followed [Mariya Davydoya's tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-simple-game-in-the-browser-with-phaser-3-and-typescript-bdc94719135/).
I have also added comments to further break down my understanding all from google searches of course.
Don't become bewitched by their dazzling light for if you let more than five collide with earth it'll all be over
